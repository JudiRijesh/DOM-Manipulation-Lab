  ## Steps:
- you have a homepage with listings for each product.

- In the js file we have a function called addToShoppingCart that takes 3 arguemnts:
 title, price, and picture

- when the button "Add To Shopping Cart" is clicked the function should be called with the values for the title, price, and picture


- Now write the code in the addToShoppingCart function to take the 3 arguements and add them to the page


- Everytime we click the "Add To Shopping Cart" that listing should appear in the section below.

- Now lets try to display the total of the price of the items in the shopping cart

- BONUS 1: After clicking the "Add To Shopping Cart" button check that the item isnt already in the cart. IF it is then alert the user that they already added the item to the shopping cart

- BONUS 2: The user Should be able to add an item twice. Add a quantity to each item that is added. If a new item is added to the shopping cart the quantity should be 1.
